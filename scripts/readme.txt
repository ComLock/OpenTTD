Scripting

OpenTTD supports scripts.

 - 'on_client.scr' is executed when you join a server as client
 - 'on_server.scr' is executed when you start a server / dedicated server
 - 'on_dedicated.scr' is additionally executed when you start a dedicated server
 - 'pre_server.scr' is executed before the server is started
 - 'pre_dedicated.scr' is additionally executed when you start a dedicated server
 - 'autoexec.scr' is executed on gamestart [use this for custom aliases per ex.]

For examples how a script can look, check the .example examples.
