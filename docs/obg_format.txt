;
; Example file for the OpenTTD Base Graphics replacement sets.
; This file consists of basically two different parts:
;  * metadata
;  * information about the files
;
; Metadata contains information about the name, version and palette
; of the graphics set.
;
[metadata]
name         = example  ; the name of the pack, preferably less than 16 characters
shortname    = XMPL     ; the short name (4 characters), used to identify this set within NewGRFs
version      = 0        ; the version of this graphics set (read as single integer)
description  = foo      ; a fairly short description of the set
palette      = DOS      ; palette used by the set; either DOS or Windows

; The files section lists the files that replace sprites.
; The file names are case sensitive.
[files]
base         = TRG1.GRF     ; GRF file with the base sprites
logos        = TRGI.GRF     ; GRF file with logos, original terrain generator sprites
arctic       = TRGC.GRF     ; GRF file with extra arctic sprites
tropical     = TRGH.GRF     ; GRF file with extra tropical sprites
toyland      = TRGT.GRF     ; GRF file with extra toyland sprites
extra        = OPENTTDD.GRF ; NewGRF file using Actions 5, 7, 9 and A to replace sprites

; The md5s section lists the MD5 checksum for the files that replace them.
; Note that the list of files is case sensitive. Each GRF listed in the
; files section must be listed here with it's MD5 checksum, otherwise you
; will get a lot of warnings when starting OpenTTD.

; The origin section provides the possibility to put and extra line into

; them where to find it. It works on the filename specified in the
; files section and if that is not found it will fall back to the default
; as shown below here.

default      = You can find it on your Transport Tycoon Deluxe CD-ROM.
