Multiplayer Manual for OpenTTD
----------------------------------------

1. Starting a Server

 - click "multiplayer" on the startup screen
 - click "start server"
 - type in a game name
 - click "start game" ,"load game" or "load scenario"
 
2. Connecting to a Server
 
 - click "multiplayer" on the startup screen
 
 - if you want to connect to any network game in your LAN click "find server"
 
 - if there were more then one server 
   - select one in the list below the buttons
   - click on "join game".

 - if you want to play over the internet you should have the ip of the game server you want connect to.
   - click direct connect
   - type in the ip address or hostname
   - if you want to add a port use :<port>
   - if you want to connect as an special player use #<player-no>
   
3. Connecting to a Server over the Console

 - open the console and type in the following command:
  
    ]connect <ip/host>:<port>#<player-no>


4. Playing Internet-Games

 - since OpenTTD 0.3.4 you can also play internet games over higher latency connections.
 - to do this the gameservers sync frequency should be highered to a decent value.
   - open the console [on the server]
   - type in the following command:
   
    ] *net_sync_freq = <4-80>
    
    default value: 4
    
   - this is lowering the sync frequency of the server and your game should be less laggy.
   - this is a server variable: it has nothing to do with the clients
   
 - you can also change when the clients ready packet is sent if you still have lags.
   - open the console
   - type in the following command:
   
    ] *net_ready_ahead = <1-8>
    
    default value: 1
    
   - in that way your client is sending its "i am ready for next sync" a bit earlier
     thats quite good for games where some players have higher latencies than the others.
   - this is a client variable: it has nothing to do with the server
 
 - to change the client timeout time
   - open the console [on the server]
   - type in the following command:
   
    ] *net_client_timeout = <30-x>
    
    default value: 300
   
   - warning: a too low value will disconnect your clients if they have a short lag
