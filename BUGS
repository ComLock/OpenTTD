KNOWN BUGS / PROBLEMS:

bridges:
- Clearing tiles which may not have a bridge above can cause random bridge pieces to appear, which leads to crash in the long run

electrified rails:
Normal and elrail depots look the same. Use 'X' (transparent buildings)
   to distinguish between them
Missing curors / icons for construction (currently using the conventional ones)
